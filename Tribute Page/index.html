                Early life and education
            </h3>
            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>
                    Kumar was born in Amritsar, Punjab, India, to Hari Om Bhatia and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi family.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India, he studied martial arts in Bangkok,
                    Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter
                </li>
                <li>
                    During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar
                    into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's
                    salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer
                    Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio.

            </h3>
            <ul class="py-4">
                <li>
                    Kumar made his first appearance as the lead actor opposite Raakhee and Shantipriya in Saugandh
                    (1991). In the same year, he acted in Kishore Vyas-directed Dancer, which received poor reviews.he
                    following year he starred in Abbas Mustan-directed suspense thriller, Khiladi, widely considered his
                    breakthrough role.A review in The Indian Express called the film "an engrossing thriller" and
                    described Kumar as impressive in the lead part, noting his physical appearance, strong screen
                    presence, and commending him for being "perfectly at ease".Kumar proved to have success with what
                    later became known as the Khiladi series. He starred in the fourth and fifth action thriller films
                    with Khiladi in the title: Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995) and Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), both directed

                    <h4>2000–2006: Hera Pheri and expansion to comedy and romantic films</h4><br>
                    In 2000, Kumar starred in the Priyadarshan-directed comedy Hera Pheri alongside Paresh Rawal and
                    Suneil Shetty. The film which was a remake of Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking, became a
                    commercial success and proved to be a turning point in Kumar's career. Hindustan Times noted
                    the film's "intense portrayal of the surreality of the human condition".His first release in 2001
                    was Suneel Darshan-directed drama Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love. Kumar was praised for his

                    Ajnabee. While reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Sarita Tanwar termed Kumar the "surprise
                    package" of the film. She added that he was "in total control as the bad guy." The film won him
                    his first Filmfare Award for Best Villain and IIFA award 2002 for Performance in a Negative Role.

                    <h4>2007–2012: Commercial success and professional setbacks</h4><br>
                    2007 proved to be Kumar's most successful year during his career in the industry, and as described
                    by box office analysts, "probably the best ever recorded by an actor, with four outright hits and no
                    flops.His next two releases, Sajid Khan-directed Heyy Babyy and Priyadarshan's Bhool Bhulaiyaa, were
                    box office successes as well.Kumar's first film of 2008, Vijay Krishna Acharya-directed action
                    thriller Tashan, marked his comeback to the Yash Raj Films banner after 11 years. Although a poll
                    (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year, the film
                    under-performed at the box office grossing ₹279 million (US$5.76 million) in India.In 2011 he
                    starred in Patiala House and Thank You. His last film of 2011 was Rohit Dhawan-directed Desi Boyz
                    (2011), which co-starred John Abraham, Chitrangada Singh and Deepika Padukone. He also co-produced a
                    film with Russell Peters titled Breakaway (dubbed into Hindi as Speedy Singhs) which is reminiscent
                    of his own Patiala House

                    <h4>2013–present: Other critical and commercial success</h4><br>
                    His first release in 2013 was Special Chabbis which earned a positive critical reception and was
                    moderately successful at the box office. Although the movie earned him positive reviews and
                    commercial success, trade analysts noted that the movie could have done much better business due to
                    its good content and Kumar's high-profile. Milan Luthria chose Kumar to play the character of Shoaib
                    Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim) in the gangster film Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, sequel to
                    Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai. It proved to be a below average at the box office. The film was
                    declared a "flop" by Box Office IndiaHis second film release in 2017 was Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. This
                    film depicted the serious social issue of toilets in certain regions of the country. Akshay's
                    performance was praised. Akshay Kumar dug a toilet in Madhya Pradesh to promote the film.His other
                    projects in 2023 includes OMG 2 - Oh my God 2 , a spiritual successor to OMG - Oh My God, the
                    official remake of Soorarai Pottru , a biopic Capsule Gill and Vedat Marathe Veer Daudle Saat, his
                    Marathi debut.
